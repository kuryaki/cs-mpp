Final Exam Points

1. Comparator 
      consistent with equals
	  comparing, thenComparing methods

2. translating lambda to inner class, and conversely

3. given a lambda, find a suitable type, turn
it into a method reference, indicate the type of 
method reference (one of 4 possibilities)

3.5 translate a method reference into a lambda

4. using default and static methods in an interface,
and the syntax rules for handling clashes

5. identify parameters and free variables in a
lambda expression

6. using the new forEach method on Iterable

7. be familiar with these functional interfaces:

Consumer
BiConsumer
Supplier
Function
BiFunction
TriFunction
Predicate
BiPredicate
Comparator

8. create lambda/stream pipeline to solve problems;
transform into a lambda library expression

9. know how to use the following stream operations

filter
map
flatMap
count
collect(Collectors.toList())
collect(Collectors.joining());
collect(Collectors.joining(", "));
collect(Collectors.summarizingInt(...))  //for IntSummaryStatistics
of
generate
iterate
limit
skip
concat
distinct
sorted
max(Comparator)
findFirst
findAny
reduce

10. IntStream operations

not available in Stream:
range
rangeClosed
Stream -> IntStream:  mapToInt
IntStream -> Stream:  boxed
toArray
sum, average, max, min

10 use the Optional class when necessary

11. techniques for stream "reuse"

12. techniques for testing a lambda/stream pipeline

13. handling exceptions that are thrown in the middle
of a lambda/stream pipeline

14. be able to use the get and put principle to guide
proper usage of ?, ?extends, and ?super wildcard types.

15. create a generic program using generics

16. restrictions on usage of type variables and parametrized types
